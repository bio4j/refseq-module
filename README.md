## RefSeq Bio4j module

This is a Bio4j module representing [RefSeq](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/). Find more information in [bio4j/modules](https://github.com/bio4j/modules).

> NCBIâ€™s Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database is a collection of taxonomically diverse, non-redundant and richly annotated sequences representing naturally occurring molecules of DNA, RNA, and protein. Included are sequences from plasmids, organelles, viruses, archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. Each RefSeq is constructed wholly from sequence data submitted to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC). Similar to a review article, a RefSeq is a synthesis of information integrated across multiple sources at a given time. RefSeqs provide a foundation for uniting sequence data with genetic and functional information. They are generated to provide reference standards for multiple purposes ranging from genome annotation to reporting locations of sequence variation in medical records.

## Usage

To use it in you sbt-project, add this to you `build.sbt`:

```scala
resolvers += "Era7 maven releases" at "http://releases.era7.com.s3.amazonaws.com"

libraryDependencies += "bio4j" %% "refseq-module" % "0.1.0"
```
